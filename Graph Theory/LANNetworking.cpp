//Contributions Handled : Graph Theory : Maahir Sharma
//Functionalities as of now:
//1) Setting up Router Networks with Edges
//2) Calculation of Routing Tables via Bellmann Ford Algorithm in O(N^2);
//3) Finding the Maximal Strongly Connected Sub Network via KosaRaju Algorithm.
//4) Handling Link Failiure of between any two network routers with a direct edge.
//5) Added Link State Packet and Flooding Feature so that when flood occurs each router has access to LSP of the flood initiator.
/*6) Added Optimal Cell Tower Placement Map is likened to a color,(channelâ€“colors are limited to four), and found where to economically position broadcast towers 
     for maximum coverage via Four Color Map Problem || Vizing's theorem (Referenced) */

  //Creating LSP of a given node

/* The ID of the node that created the LSP
      A list of directly connected neighbors of that node, with the cost of the link to each one
      A sequence number
      A time to live for this packet */
  /* Consider a node X that receives a copy of an LSP that originated at some other node Y. 
  If not, it stores the LSP. If it already has a copy, it compares the sequence numbers; 
  if the new LSP has a larger sequence number, it is assumed to be the more recent, and that LSP is stored, replacing the old one.
  A smaller (or equal) sequence number would imply an LSP older (or not newer) than the one stored, so it would be discarded and no further action would be needed. 
  If the received LSP was the newer one, X then sends a copy of that LSP to all of its neighbors except the neighbor from which the LSP was just received.
  The fact that the LSP is not sent back to the node from which it was received helps to bring an end to the flooding of an LSP. 
  Since X passes the LSP on to all its neighbors, who then turn around and do the same thing, the most recent copy of the LSP eventually reaches all nodes.*/
